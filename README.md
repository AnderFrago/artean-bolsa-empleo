# Single Page Application for a Job bank

## Developed with Symfony and Angular

### @author: anderfrago

The aim of this project is to develop a job bank that is simple to use and easy to adapt to the different needs of the users.

To achieve this, the wizard for generating job offers and CVs of alumni has been simplified. In the current version both employers and students can upload their own PDF documents with the information they consider appropriate.
The great advantage of this application is that it allows the administrator users (Artean) to search through key words in the students' CVs. To achieve this, the students' PDFs are transformed into text that is stored in a column of the database.

In addition, to avoid the massive registration of fake accounts, either from former students or employers, every time there is a new registration it must be validated by the account administrator.
